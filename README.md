# Ride-Sharing-Churn-Prediction
Predict rider retention based on the rider information and trips information. Understand what is the most important factors for riders to stay.


## Data
This sample dataset is from a cohort of users who signed up for an account in January 2014. The data was pulled on July 1, 2014. A user would be considered as active if they have taken a trip in preceding 30 days (from the day the data was pulled).

<br>
Detailed description of the data:

```
city: city this user signed up in
phone: primary device for this user
signup_date: date of account registration; in the form `YYYYMMDD`
last_trip_date: the last time this user completed a trip; in the form `YYYYMMDD`
avg_dist: the average distance (in miles) per trip taken in the first 30 days after signup
avg_rating_by_driver: the rider’s average rating over all of their trips
avg_rating_of_driver: the rider’s average rating of their drivers over all of their trips
surge_pct: the percent of trips taken with surge multiplier > 1
avg_surge: The average surge multiplier over all of this user’s trips
trips_in_first_30_days: the number of trips this user took in the first 30 days after signing up
luxury_car_user: TRUE if the user took a luxury car in their first 30 days; FALSE otherwise
weekday_pct: the percent of the user’s trips occurring during a weekday
```

## Approach
- understand the relationship between different features and target variable
- create new features to capture signals in the data
- implement Logistic Regression on rider data and tested with created features
- repeat and iterate above steps to identify the most important factors for rider retention
